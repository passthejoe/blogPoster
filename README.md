## blogPoster

blogPoster aims to make it easy to create social-media-style posts and send those posts to both a social-media service and a personal blog.

This is a *very* personal project that I use just about every day. Right now it's a terminal program that uses Ruby and a few Gems to take URLs and make it quick and easy to create and post a social-media entry based on that URL. It can also help the user create a post from scratch.

The way the app is structured right now, it creates and formats posts for an [Ode](http://ode.io) blog and the Twitter social-media service.

You've probably heard of Twitter, and you might already use it. That's a good reason to be interested in this project. But I could potentially code this app to post to any other service that has an API I can figure out. Right now I use Twitter, so it'll probably stay how it is.

I'm pretty sure you haven't heard of Ode, the Rob Reed-coded, Perl-based blogging software that is inspired by [Bloxsom](http://blosxom.sourceforge.net/) ([see a little more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blosxom)).

I have been using Ode as my personal blogging system for many years now, and I'm hopeful that Rob will release a new version soon. He says he wants [to change the name of the project to Ebeling].

Future development plans include adding the option to post to static sites generated by programs like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

But right now I use Ode, and that's what the script works with.

I'm using FTP to do the uploads, and users of this script should know that it's not the most secure protocol for file transfer. That is something I'd like to work on.

To use this app for posting to your blog, you'll need to enter your FTP login and password in the configuration file `blogPoster_configuration.rb`, which is created when you run the `blogPoster.rb` script for the first time.

Before you use the app to post to Twitter, you need to get [a Twitter Development Account](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/developer-portal/overview) which is harder to get than it used to be. Basically you need to tell them that you are using a Ruby script to post tweets from your desktop, and then they should say "OK," and give you the keys/tokens you need to enter in `blogPoster_configuration.rb` to make the app work with Twitter.
